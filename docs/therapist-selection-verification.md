# Therapist Selection Verification

This document outlines the verification process for the TherapistSelection page to ensure it correctly displays clinicians licensed in the client's state with the updated authentication system.

## Overview

The TherapistSelection page is responsible for:
1. Retrieving the client's state from the 'clients' table
2. Fetching clinicians from the database
3. Filtering them based on the client's state using the 'clinician_licensed_states' array
4. Displaying the filtered list with proper information (name, image, bio, credentials)

## Verification Steps

### 1. Console Logging

We've added console logs to verify:
- The client's state is being correctly retrieved from the auth context
- The filtering by state is working properly
- The correct fields are being displayed

To check these logs:
1. Log in as a client
2. Navigate to `/therapist-selection`
3. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
4. Review the logs prefixed with `[TherapistSelection]` and `[useTherapistSelection]`

### 2. Debug Utility

We've created a `TherapistSelectionDebugger` utility that provides methods to verify:
- Client state retrieval from the database
- Therapist filtering by state
- Field verification for therapist data

This utility is automatically run when the TherapistSelection page loads and logs its results to the console.

### 3. Test Page

For more detailed testing, we've created a dedicated test page at `/debug/therapist-selection` that allows:
- Viewing the current client state
- Updating the client state for testing different scenarios
- Running verification tests to check filtering logic
- Viewing detailed test results

## Key Files

1. **TherapistSelection.tsx**
   - Main component for therapist selection
   - Uses client state from auth context
   - Displays therapists with proper fields

2. **useTherapistSelection.tsx**
   - Hook for fetching and filtering therapists
   - Implements state-based filtering logic
   - Handles loading, error, and empty states

3. **therapistSelectionDebugger.ts**
   - Utility for verifying TherapistSelection functionality
   - Provides methods for testing client state and therapist filtering

4. **TherapistSelectionTestPage.tsx**
   - Debug page for testing TherapistSelection functionality
   - Allows updating client state and running verification tests

## Field Verification

The TherapistSelection page should correctly use:
- `client_state` from the 'clients' table
- `clinician_licensed_states` array from the 'clinicians' table
- `clinician_image_url` for therapist images
- `clinician_professional_name` for therapist names
- `clinician_bio` for therapist descriptions
- `clinician_type` for therapist credentials

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Client with State**
   - Expected: Only therapists licensed in that state should be displayed
   - Verification: Check console logs for filtering results

2. **Client without State**
   - Expected: All therapists should be displayed (no filtering)
   - Verification: Check console logs for "No filtering applied"

3. **No Matching Therapists**
   - Expected: Empty state message should be displayed
   - Verification: Navigate to test page, set state to a value with no matching therapists

4. **Therapist Selection**
   - Expected: Selected therapist should be highlighted and selection should be saved
   - Verification: Select a therapist and check console logs for selection confirmation

## Troubleshooting

If issues are encountered:
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Use the test page to verify client state and therapist filtering
3. Check database schema for any column name mismatches
4. Verify the client has a valid state value in the database

## Recent Fixes

The TherapistSelection page had several issues that were fixed:
1. Database schema mismatch (`clinician_title` vs `clinician_type`)
2. Type errors in the code
3. Field reference issues
4. Null safety improvements

These fixes are documented in `src/debug/THERAPIST_SELECTION_FIX.md`.
