# Code Organization Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Documentation and Analysis**:
   - Created a comprehensive analysis of the monorepo transition options
   - Documented the current code structure and duplication
   - Created clear guidelines for code boundaries

2. **Core Package Improvements**:
   - Added documentation to session note hooks
   - Created a proper index.ts file for easier imports
   - Added a README.md with usage guidelines
   - Updated package.json to include React dependencies

3. **Migration Planning**:
   - Created a step-by-step migration plan for removing duplicated code
   - Documented testing and rollback procedures

## Next Steps

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Remove Duplicated Session Note Hooks**:
   - After confirming that the core package hooks are working correctly, remove:
     - `src/hooks/useSessionNoteState.tsx`
     - `src/hooks/useSessionNoteSave.tsx`
     - `src/hooks/useSessionNoteValidation.tsx`

2. **Fix TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Resolve remaining TypeScript errors in the core package
   - Ensure proper type definitions are available

3. **Add Boundary Comments**:
   - Add comments to key files indicating whether they're clinician-facing or patient-facing
   - Example: `// CLINICIAN-ONLY: This component is only used in the clinician experience`

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)

1. **Consolidate Timezone Utilities**:
   - Move all timezone-related code to the core package
   - Update imports throughout the application

2. **Extract UI Components**:
   - Move reusable UI components to a dedicated package
   - Standardize component APIs

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Consolidate error handling utilities in the core package
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns

### Long-term (1-3 months)

1. **Extract Domain-Specific Packages**:
   - Create a calendar package for all calendar-related functionality
   - Create a session-notes package for all session note functionality

2. **Implement Feature Folders**:
   - Reorganize code into feature-based folders
   - Example: `src/features/calendar/`, `src/features/sessionNotes/`

3. **Consider App Separation**:
   - Evaluate separating clinician and patient functionality into distinct applications
   - Share code through the core package

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Code Reviews**:
   - Enforce code organization guidelines in code reviews
   - Prevent new code duplication

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Keep documentation up-to-date as the codebase evolves
   - Document new patterns and best practices

3. **Regular Audits**:
   - Periodically audit the codebase for duplication and boundary violations
   - Address issues promptly

## Conclusion

By following this plan, we can gradually improve the organization of the codebase, making it easier to work on different parts of the application independently. This approach balances immediate improvements with long-term architectural goals.
