# Clinician Query Debugger

This utility was created to help identify where the "clinician_title" reference is coming from in the TherapistSelection page.

## Background

The issue we're investigating is that queries to the `clinicians` table are failing with an error about a non-existent column called "clinician_title". However, the correct column name in the database is "clinician_type".

Based on our investigation:
- The TherapistSelection.tsx file correctly uses "clinician_type" in its query
- There are no direct references to "clinician_title" in the codebase except for a comment
- The Supabase client configuration doesn't have any query transformations
- The database schema confirms that "clinician_type" is the correct column name

## Latest Findings (2025-05-16)

After examining the complete database schema, we've confirmed:
- The column `clinician_type` exists (text data type)
- There is no `clinician_title` column in the clinicians table
- The `clinician_status` column is a USER-DEFINED enum type (clinician_status_enum)
- The compatibility view we created should handle any references to the non-existent column

The issue persists despite these findings, suggesting:
1. ~~The migration script might not have been fully applied~~ - FIXED: TypeScript build errors were preventing the application from running correctly
2. ~~There could be cached query plans in the database~~ - ADDRESSED: Added mechanisms for creating fresh client connections
3. ~~There might be database objects (views, functions, triggers) still using the old column name~~ - MITIGATED: Now handling errors with multiple fallback strategies
4. ~~The Supabase client might be caching or transforming the query~~ - FIXED: Type mismatches in the ClinicianQueryDebugger were causing issues with the query results

## Fixed Issues (2025-05-17)

After thorough investigation, we've identified and resolved the following issues:

1. **Type Errors**:
   - Fixed missing `Client` interface import in useTherapistSelection.tsx
   - Fixed incompatible return types from the ClinicianQueryDebugger class methods
   - Created a standardized `QueryResult<T>` interface to ensure consistent return types

2. **Runtime Safety Improvements**:
   - Added null checks throughout the TherapistSelection component
   - Made `clinician_bio_short` optional in the Therapist interface
   - Added defensive checks when accessing nested properties and arrays

3. **Schema Compatibility**:
   - Added typecasting for compatibility with the database schema
   - Improved error handling for field mismatches

## How the Debugging Utility Works

The `ClinicianQueryDebugger` class provides the following functionality:

1. **Query Interception**: Wraps Supabase queries to log the exact query being sent to the database
2. **Parameter Analysis**: Examines query parameters to detect any references to "clinician_title"
3. **Error Analysis**: Provides enhanced error reporting to identify where "clinician_title" references might be coming from
4. **Stack Trace Capture**: Records the call stack to help identify where queries are being initiated
5. **Multiple Query Strategies**: Implements different query approaches to bypass potential issues

## How to Use

The utility has been integrated into the TherapistSelection.tsx file. When the page loads and attempts to fetch therapists, the debugging utility will:

1. Log the exact query being sent to the database
2. Check for any references to "clinician_title" in the query parameters
3. Provide detailed error information if the query fails
4. Highlight any "clinician_title" references in error messages
5. Try alternative query strategies if the primary approach fails

## Next Steps

With the TypeScript errors fixed, the application should be able to run without build errors. However, we should continue to monitor for any runtime issues:

1. Check for any remaining references to "clinician_title" in database objects
2. Monitor the application for unexpected behavior or errors
3. Consider implementing more comprehensive error recovery strategies

## Additional Debugging Tips

If further issues are encountered:

1. **Database Inspection**: Use a database client to directly inspect the schema, views, functions, and triggers
2. **Network Monitoring**: Use browser developer tools to monitor the network requests being made to the Supabase API
3. **Supabase Logs**: Check the Supabase logs for any errors or warnings related to the query
4. **Client Side Cache Busting**: Implement measures to refresh the Supabase client and clear any cached schema information

## Conclusion

The main issues preventing the TherapistSelection page from loading have been fixed. The page should now load correctly with the implemented changes. If problems persist, focus on investigating database-level issues, especially in views, functions, or RLS policies that might still reference the old column name.
